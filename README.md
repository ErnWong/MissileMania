9098A Missile Mania Code for Robot 1
====================================

**Caution:** Not the most beautiful code to see.

### Dependencies

You'll nee a version of RobotC working in order to build this and download it to your robot. (Hang on, are you sure you want to run my code?)

### Usage

Get the code by either downloading the zip file, or clone it with git:

```
git clone https://github.com/ErnWong/MissileMania.git
```

Then fire up your RobotC, open `main.c`. Connect your VEX robot to your computer. Then compile and download the program by clicking the nice big buttons.
